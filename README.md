# All That You Touch

Is an interactive web zine as a portal/altar/love letter to [Earthseed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthseed), Lauren Oya Olamina, and [Octavia E. Butler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octavia_E._Butler). Each quote is from the beginning of each chapter in [Parable of the Sower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Sower_(novel)). The images are AI generated using [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2) with the prompt, “An oil painting by Octavia Butler of a 15 year old black girl amongst the stars”.

This project was built inside [Seeda School](https://www.seedaschool.com/) by [Ayana Zaire Cotton](https://ayanazairecotton.com/).
